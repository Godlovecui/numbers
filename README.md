This repository tries to create a repositorz of handwritten digits,
much like
the
[MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
In Switzerland, the handwritten digites sometimes look a bit
different, which is why we undertake this effort.

Our goal is 10,000 handwritten digits.
